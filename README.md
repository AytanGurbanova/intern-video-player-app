# Intern Video App

A simple Flutter video app for internship demonstration.  
This app lets users sign up, log in, view a list of videos, watch videos, and see a live stream.  
The UI uses a pastel, icy-cool blue and white theme inspired by BN Cool.

---

## Features

- User sign up and login (with Firebase Auth)
- Video list (from Firestore)
- Video playback (from Firebase Storage)
- Live stream (YouTube embed, from Firestore config)
- Clean, modern pastel blue/white UI

## Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd intern_video_app
```

### 2. **Install Flutter dependencies**

```sh
flutter pub get
```

### 3. **Firebase Setup**

- Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Add an iOS and/or Android app in Firebase Console
- Download `google-services.json` (Android) and/or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) and place them in the correct directories
- Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password) in Firebase Console
- Enable **Firestore Database** and **Firebase Storage**
- Set up your `firebase_options.dart` (usually auto-generated by FlutterFire CLI)

### 4. **Firestore Structure**

- `users` collection: Each user will have a document with their info (created automatically)
- `videos` collection: Each document should have at least:
  - `title` (String)
  - `storagePath` (String, path to video in Firebase Storage)
  - `thumbnailPath` (String, path to thumbnail in Firebase Storage)
- `config/live` document: Should have a field `youtubeID` (String) for the live stream

### 5. **Firebase Rules**

#### Firestore Rules (example):

```plaintext
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /videos/{videoId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /config/{docId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Storage Rules (example):

```plaintext
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /videos/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /thumbnails/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Running the App

flutter run
```
